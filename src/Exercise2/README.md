# Exercise 2: Factorial Calculator

## Objective
Write a program to compute the factorial of a given number.

## Instructions
1. Implement the program in `Factorial.java`.
2. The program should:
   - Prompt the user for an integer.
   - Calculate the factorial of the number using iteration.

### Example
Input: `5`  
Output: `Factorial of 5 is 120`

## Hints
- Factorial is the product of all positive integers up to a number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).
- Use a `for` loop to calculate the factorial.
- Be cautious with large numbers; use `long` for the result to handle bigger values.

## Steps to Run
1. Navigate to the exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd src/Exercise2
