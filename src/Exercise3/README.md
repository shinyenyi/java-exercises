# Exercise 3: Even Sum of Fibonacci Series

## Objective
Write a program to calculate the sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to a given number `N`.

## Instructions
1. Implement the program in `EvenFibonacciSum.java`.
2. The program should:
   - Prompt the user for the value of `N`.
   - Compute the sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to `N`.

### Example
Input: `10`  
Output: `Sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to 10 is 10`

## Hints
- Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
- Use a loop to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- Add a number to the sum only if it's even (`num % 2 == 0`).

## Steps to Run
1. Navigate to the exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd src/Exercise3
